                <p>
                    On the main screen, images can be uploaded. These will then be converted to a suitable
                    format to allow deep zooming. This conversion progress may take some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an image has been processed, it will appear in the <em>Uploaded images</em>
                    list. From there, it can be opened by clicking its thumbnail. This will take you
                    to the segmentation mask screen.
                </p>

                <h6>The segmentation mask screen</h6>
                <p>
                    On this screen a segmentation mask can be uploaded for the selected image.
                    This will process the mask and add it to the <em>Uploaded masks</em> list.
                    Processing a mask should not take long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once processing is finished, the mask can be selected by clicking its thumbnail.
                    This will take you to the annotation screen.
                </p>

                <h6>The annotation screen</h6>
                <p>
                    The annotation screen shows the selected image, initially in full screen.
                    In the bottom-left corner, the name of the selected image is shown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The viewer can be moved around by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor,
                    or by using the arrow keys. You can zoom in and out by scrolling, or using the
                    zoom controls in the bottom-right corner of the viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Image segments can be selected by clicking on them. This will open a popup,
                    where the segment's accuracy can be rated. The segment can also be edited,
                    simplified or removed.
