                <p>
                    On the main screen, images can be uploaded. These will then be converted to a suitable
                    format to allow deep zooming. This conversion progress may take some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an image has been processed, it will appear in the <em>Uploaded images</em>
                    list. From there, it can be opened by clicking its thumbnail. This will take you to
                    the annotation screen.
                </p>

                <h6>The annotation screen</h6>
                <p>
                    The annotation screen shows the selected image, initially in full screen.
                    In the bottom-left corner, the name of the selected image is shown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The viewer can be moved around by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor, or by using
                    the arrow keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can zoom in by scrolling, or using the zoom controls in the bottom-right
                    corner of the viewer.
                </p>
                <p>In the top-left corner is a list of image controls:</p>

                </table>

                <h6>The mask menu</h6>
                <p>
                    Clicking the <em>Set mask</em> button opens the mask menu. From there,
                    a segmentation mask can be uploaded. This should not take long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a mask has been uploaded, it can be applied by clicking its thumbnail.
                    This shows the mask in an overlay on the image.
                </p>
                <p>It also enables several editing tools in the top-left corner:</p>
